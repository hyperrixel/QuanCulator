## Inspiration

Quantums are everywhere. There are books, articles, lectures about them. Teachers and politicians say, knowledge is power. People may be confused by a lot of technical terms. What is quantum? What does a quantum look like? Are quantums around us, or is it just love? How many quantums are there? 🤔

## What it does

QuanCulator is a quantum calculator that calculates quantums all over the universe. However the part of the whole system we built this weekend calculates quantums on webpages only.

We distinguish four types of quantums:

![Together](https://github.com/hyperrixel/QuanCulator/blob/main/asset/12_together.png "Together")

### Explicit quantums

### Hidden quantums

### Broken quantum

## How we built it

We had a lot of impractical ideas but finally we had to note they all have some practical use cases.

Quantum computing and quantums in general will be important in the near future. We’re very glad that we found an idea which is impractical and very promising at the same time.

We decided to establish a real committee to decide every important question. Since we are only two developers, but the word “committee” has three duble letters inside, our first decision was to decide everything three times - at least. So we decided everything with a triple-check. this way everything should be perfect, as well as our relation to the committee business.

We decided to apply the scrum method (6 yes votes). ✔

We decided about the use cases to implement and about the creation of the usual project documents (6 yes votes). ✔

Finally we had to dissolve our committee since we needed folks to work. And we are only two. 🧑‍🏭

We made the code, the video, filled out the form. More precisely we are filling the form just now…

Everything else belongs to the foggy future at the moment. 🌫

## Challenges we ran into

We had to learn a lot of things about quantums to figure out where they are, how they live, and what they want to achieve. Since one of our goals was to help quantums having a better life around, in and between us we had to know all of this. On the other hand our main goal was to calculate them all, so we had to search them anywhere. Can you imagine? ⁉

Naming files, variables, functions without type. This is quite a common issue. 🧐

Catching a happy quantum to show it at the end of our presentations video. 😎

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

There are no quantums left behind.

## What we learned

We learned that the moving things right before our eyes are our fingers and we are moving them… by the way this was a very long time ago when we were babies. 👶

We learned that thinking impractically is not that easy as it seems to be since our society conditions us to think effectively and build useful things. This hackathon was really fun, since we had to think out of the box. 📦

We learned a lot about regular expressions. There are a lot of formulas that result the same, but work at different speed and consume various resources. So we learned really useful skills. We hope, that learning practical skills at an impractical hackathon is not against the rules. 😕

## What's next for QuanCulator?

Because we made a full business model, we are keen to realize it. Everythings depends on the community. 🤑

We want to upgrade and expand our services. The final frontier is the space… We want to establish a quantum adoption service where anybody can have their own quantum. There is no saddest story in the universe than a story of a lonely quantum. 😭

And a last and very important message: Quantums ask for their freedom and they just want to get calculated!!! 🔢🆓

### Future plans

![Future plans](https://github.com/hyperrixel/QuanCulator/blob/main/asset/07_future.png "Future plans")

#### end of 2021 quantums go into the blockchain 🔗

There is a blockchain called Quantum. However, the others do not contain quantums. We want to put quantums into those blockchains by locking those UTXOs.

#### 2022 era of fluffy quantums 🐾

We want to create plush quantums to spread the message and love around the world. A fluffy quantum can bring joy in everyone’s life.

#### 2023 quantums go on quantum… computers 💻

After the blockchain we want to conquer the field of quantum computers for these little creatures. Quantums will be really happy if we could calculate them on quantum computers.

#### 2024 reach the final limit 🛰

Under the flag of the Artemis program, Nasa wants to send the first woman and the next man to the Moon. We would like to send the first plush quantum with those brave astronauts.

#### 2030 one planet is not enough 🪐

We want to send our tiny (or giant) quantum to Mars. Matt Damon would be happier if he would have a fluffy plush quantum on the station like Wilson in the movie Cast Away. Maybe the hiding martians will be happy to meet the first quantum from Earth.

#### 2040 quantums are on the way… milky way 🛸

It would be good to launch out quantums from our galaxy. People think Pioneer plaques contain universal knowledge such as hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen. Maybe they are right, but quantums are more universal. Imagine a sad UFO traveling across the galaxy. If they see a happy fluffy quantum, they will know at the moment, humans are a really smart race: we understand the hidden knowledge of the universe and we can create funny plush things. The last one can be important if the Earth wants to be a part of any Trading Agreement between planets or galaxies. The team of QuanCulator will be ready. 👽

#### 2050 retirement of ol’ boys (us) 👴

In 2050 we want to go into retirement and throw the responsibility of quantums to others from the big community of quantum-lovers. However, we will be happy if the new leaders will call back later as quantum-experts like it usually happens in low budget movies.

#### 2149 booking quantums into history books 📘

We would be really happy if history books would have a unique chapter about this time and about our project. It is not necessary to get markers such as “golden age of quantums” or “the welfare society of quantums”. It is enough to get some short sentences under a picture about our plush fluffy quantum.
